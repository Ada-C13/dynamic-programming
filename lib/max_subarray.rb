# Write a method to find the contiguous subarray in a 1-dimensional array with the largest sum.

# This can be solved using Kadane's Algorithm

# Initialize:
#     max_so_far = 0
#     max_ending_here = 0

# Loop for each element of the array
#   (a) max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i]
#   (b) if(max_ending_here < 0)
#             max_ending_here = 0
#   (c) if(max_so_far < max_ending_here)
#             max_so_far = max_ending_here
# return max_so_far

# The idea of the Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array (max_ending_here is used for this). 
# And keep track of the maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments (max_so_far is used for this). 
# Each time we get a positive sum compare it with max_so_far and update max_so_far if it is greater than max_so_far

# There is also a subtle divide & conquer algorithm for this.
